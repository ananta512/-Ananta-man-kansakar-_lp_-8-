If a client of want a custom designed/printed T-shirt manufacturing company ,then I would suggest the client to go for websites for startup. As a PM I would to go with agile model to be followed for website development as it better for a startup company. Role as PM would be-
1. Customer Collaboration
2. Responding to change
3. Time estimation
4. Controlling Quality
Now for planning the developing of the website we go into different steps
1.	First we collected all the feature our customer desirer and make a development plan and time frame to give to the developer and coder .
2.	Each worker are divided in initial phase of development form developer to tester.
3.	To monitor the project development I as PM would weekly meeting to discuss the  progress for website.
